# already matches this branch's lock (v0.8.0 ships Ray 2.58.0).
#
# History, because both directions are wrong with the wrong image:
#   - On v0.7.0 (Ray 2.55.1) `uv run` rebuilt the venv to Ray 2.58.0 and the driver was
#     refused by the cluster ray.sub had started from the container venv.
#   - Falling back to the container's interpreter then failed differently: the merged
#     branch needs deps v0.7.0 predates (nemo.lens), and on v0.8.0 it needs a NEWER
#     nemo.lens than the image ships -- `span_attributes` is missing.
# Patching single gaps one at a time does not converge; the branch's lock is the only
# consistent description of what it needs. With v0.8.0 the cluster's Ray and the lock's
# Ray agree, so rebuilding the venv is safe and resolves every gap at once.
#
# Set PIPECLEAN_CONTAINER_PYTHON=1 to use the image's interpreter instead, which only
# works if the image already satisfies every dependency the branch imports.
